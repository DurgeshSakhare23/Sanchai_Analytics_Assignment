# 🌦️ SanchAI Analytics – Weather Query Assistant  
**Internship Technical Assessment Submission**

A minimal, clean, and assignment-focused full-stack application that allows users to ask **weather-related questions for any city** using natural language.

This project demonstrates **LLM-based tool orchestration** using **LangChain**, with a **FastAPI backend** and a **React frontend**.

---

## 📌 Assignment Objective

Build a web application where:
- Users can ask questions like *“What’s the weather in Pune?”*
- The backend uses an **LLM with a tool** to fetch weather data
- The frontend displays the generated response
- Non-weather queries are handled gracefully

This project strictly follows the scope provided in the assignment.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

The backend is powered by a **LangChain Agent** that:
- Interprets the user’s natural language query
- Decides whether a weather tool should be invoked
- Calls the OpenWeather API via a tool when required
- Returns a human-readable response to the frontend

There is:
- ❌ No manual keyword detection  
- ❌ No regex-based city extraction  
- ❌ No hard-coded business logic  

All reasoning and decision-making is handled by the **LLM agent**.

### 🚫 Non-Weather Query Handling
If the user asks something unrelated, the agent politely explains that it only supports weather queries.
